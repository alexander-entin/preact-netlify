CRS
as of September 6, 2024, $4 billion of the $6.33
billion in Ukraine-related FMF had been notified to Congress

$595.9 million in active FMS cases with Ukraine (it is unclear how
much of this total is financed by FMF)

As of August 8, 2024, DOD reported having obligated $15.8 billion, or 48%, of
the $32.7 billion it has available for USAI contracting actions.174 What factors
affect DOD’s rate of obligation?

As of August 8, 2024, DOD reported having obligated $21.0 billion, or 46%, of
the $45.8 billion it has available to replace items already transferred to Ukraine
via PDA.177 What factors affect DOD’s rate of obligation?

GAO

Service branches’ data indicate that most of the
defense articles approved for provision to Ukraine under USAI had not
been delivered as of July 2023. Specifically, as of July 2023, DOD had
completed deliveries in eight of its 118 USAI cases, partially delivered
defense articles in 29, and made no record of delivery in 56 (see fig. 6).41
For these 56 cases, we were unable to determine whether the defense
articles were not delivered, partially delivered, or fully delivered

One component, for example, valued 10 vehicles that it provided under
PDA to Ukraine at a total of $7,050,000; however, the supporting
documentation indicated that the net book value for each vehicle was
zero dollars. If the component had used net book value as directed by the
FMR accounting policy, it would have valued these 10 vehicles at zero
dollars, leaving over $7 million in additional drawdown authority for
Ukraine. According to these officials, following the FMR accounting policy
by valuing these articles at zero dollars could theoretically allow DOD to
provide unlimited quantities of certain articles to Ukraine, and they did not
believe that was Congress’s intent when establishing a maximum
aggregate value in the Foreign Assistance Act.

According to this official, the component has reviewed the
valuation methods for defense articles that were omitted in its original
review and, as of April 2024, has identified additional reductions in values
totaling almost $2 billion

The component has thus far identified $119 million of additional
reductions in values. The $2 billion above and this $119 million are in
addition to the $6.2 billion misvaluation originally identified in 2023

We found that none of the DOD
components were consistently following the June 2023 memorandum

In another record, the supporting
documentation indicated that a set of 179,900 defense articles were
priced at $20.92 each, which would result in a total value of
approximately $3.8 million. However, the value that the component
provided for the presidential determination was $107.9 million, a
difference of $104.1 million.
