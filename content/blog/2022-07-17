##What Heavy Weapons the West Has (and Hasn’t) Sent Ukraine

**_Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS)_**  — stated need by Ukraine: 100 units.

**DELIVERED**: RM-70 (an upgraded Czechoslovak version of the BM-21 “Grad”) from Czechia, the exact number is unconfirmed but is reported to be “about 20,” according to the Wall Street Journal [[1](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-04-13/card/czech-republic-supplies-heavy-weapons-to-ukraine-wgT3jSDz1RwRr9JZhzeL)]. Several of these vehicles were shown being transported via rail to Ukraine by independent monitor Ukraine Weapons Tracker [[2](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1514325652396249097)].

**DELIVERED**: An unknown number of BM-21 “Grad” MLRS from Poland have also been delivered to Ukraine, as confirmed by Polish state radio in late April [[3](https://www.polskieradio.pl/397/7835/Artykul/2948212,%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0-%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B5-200-%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%A272-%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%91%D0%9C%D0%9F)].

The “Grad” and similar systems are old and relatively unsophisticated – not too different from the famous “Stalin’s organ” Katyusha rocket launchers that terrified German soldiers during the Second World War – but the Ukrainians know how to use and maintain them, and they are still capable of saturating an area with fire in a short time. They are also relatively common in the arsenals of ex-Soviet NATO members.
